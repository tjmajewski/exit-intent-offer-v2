## Configuring Your Settings

Navigate to **Settings** to access all Pro features. Your settings are organized into tabs:

### Quick Setup Tab

Configure the basics of your modal:

#### Modal Content
- **Modal Headline**: Main attention-grabbing text
- **Modal Body Text**: Supporting copy explaining your offer
- **CTA Button Text**: Call-to-action button text

#### Template Selection (NEW IN PRO)
Choose from 5 professionally designed templates:

1. **Discount**: Classic percentage or fixed amount discount offer
2. **Free Shipping**: Offer free shipping on orders
3. **Urgency**: Create urgency with limited-time language
4. **Welcome**: Welcome first-time visitors with a special offer
5. **Reminder**: Remind returning visitors about their cart

Each template has optimized copy and layout for its specific purpose.

#### Trigger Configuration
- **Exit Intent**: Mouse movement detection for abandonment
- **Time Delay**: Set seconds before showing (15-120 seconds)
- **Cart Value Conditions**: Min and max thresholds

#### Discount Settings
- **Discount Type**: Percentage or fixed amount
- **How It Works**: Resparq automatically creates the discount code in Shopify when you save
  - Percentage codes: `15OFF`, `20OFF`, etc.
  - Fixed amount codes: `10DOLLARSOFF`, `25DOLLARSOFF`, etc.
- **Auto-Apply**: Automatically apply code at checkout (recommended - enabled by default)

### Advanced Tab (NEW IN PRO)

#### Redirect Destination
- **Checkout**: Send directly to checkout (higher conversion, recommended)
- **Cart**: Send to cart page (gives review opportunity)

#### Cart Value Targeting
- **Minimum Cart Value**: Only show if cart is above this amount
- **Maximum Cart Value**: Only show if cart is below this amount
- Advanced logic: Combine with time delays for sophisticated targeting

### AI Settings Tab (PRO EXCLUSIVE)

This is where Pro becomes powerful. Configure AI to automatically optimize your offers:

#### Optimization Goal
Choose what the AI should optimize for:
- **Maximize Revenue** (default): Prioritize total revenue generation
- **Maximize Conversions**: Prioritize conversion rate (more orders, possibly lower revenue per order)

#### Discount Aggression Level (0-10 Scale)

Control how aggressive your discount offers are:
- **Level 0**: No discounts (announcement mode only)
- **Levels 1-3**: Conservative (5-10% discounts)
- **Levels 4-6**: Moderate (10-20% discounts)
- **Levels 7-9**: Aggressive (20-30% discounts)
- **Level 10**: Maximum (30%+ discounts)

Recommendation: Start at level 5, monitor conversion rate and revenue, adjust accordingly.

#### AI Discount Code Mode

Choose how discount codes are generated:

**Generic Codes (Default)**
- Same discount code reused for all customers
- Simpler to manage
- Must create code in Shopify first
- No expiration

**Unique Codes with 24-Hour Expiry**
- AI generates unique codes for each customer
- Codes expire after 24 hours
- Creates urgency
- Automatic cleanup (no manual management needed)
- Prevents code sharing

Recommendation: Use unique codes for higher conversion rates and urgency.

#### Budget Cap System

Protect your margins with spending limits:

**Maximum Discount Budget**
- Set the maximum dollar amount you're willing to spend on discounts
- Example: $500/week or $2,000/month

**Time Period**
- Weekly: Resets every Monday
- Monthly: Resets on your billing anniversary

**What Happens at Cap:**
- Modals switch to announcement mode (no discount)
- OR modals pause entirely (your choice)
- You receive email notification
- Dashboard shows budget exhaustion warning

#### Promotional Detection (Warning Only)

Pro tier includes site-wide promotion detection:
- **Automatic Detection**: AI scans your store for active promotions
- **Dashboard Warning**: You'll see alerts when conflicts are detected
- **No Auto-Optimization**: This is a warning only (auto-optimization is Enterprise-only)

Example: If you're running a site-wide 20% off sale, Resparq will warn you that your exit-intent offer might be redundant or confusing to customers.

#### Social Proof Display (LOCKED - Upgrade to Enterprise)

You'll see this setting but it's locked on Pro:
- Enable social proof in modals (e.g., "Join 1,234 happy customers")

## Mastering Your Analytics

Pro tier unlocks comprehensive performance analytics.

## Using AI Mode: Step-by-Step Guide

AI mode is one of the most powerful features of Pro. Here's how to use it effectively:

### Step 1: Enable AI Mode

1. Go to **Settings** → **AI Settings Tab**
2. Review the AI optimization settings
3. Choose your optimization goal (Revenue vs. Conversions)
4. Set your discount aggression level (start at 5)
5. Choose discount code mode (Generic or Unique)
6. Set budget caps (recommended: $500/week to start)
7. Save settings

### Step 2: Let AI Learn (Initial Phase)

- **Duration**: 7-14 days minimum
- **Required Data**: At least 100-200 impressions
- **What's Happening**: AI tests 2 variants against each other
  - Variant A: Baseline offer
  - Variant B: AI-generated alternative
- **Your Job**: Monitor dashboard, but don't make changes yet

### Step 3: Monitor AI Performance

Check your dashboard daily:
- **AI Performance Section**: See which variant is winning
- **Conversion Rate**: Is it improving over time?
- **Revenue**: Is total revenue increasing?
- **Budget**: Are you staying within your cap?

### Step 4: Adjust Based on Results

After 2 weeks, analyze:
- If conversion rate is high but revenue is low: Decrease aggression level
- If conversion rate is low: Increase aggression level
- If you're hitting budget cap too quickly: Reduce aggression or increase cap
- If variants are performing similarly: Let AI continue testing

### Step 5: Scale What Works

Once you've found a winning formula:
- Keep AI mode running to continuously optimize
- Consider upgrading to Enterprise for 10 variants (more testing power)
- Increase your budget cap if ROI is positive
- Expand to more templates (test Free Shipping vs. Discount)

### AI Mode Best Practices

**Do:**
- Give AI at least 2 weeks before judging performance
- Set realistic budget caps
- Monitor daily but adjust weekly
- Trust the data (AI is testing scientifically)

**Don't:**
- Change settings every day (disrupts learning)
- Set budget caps too low (AI needs room to test)
- Disable AI mode before 100 impressions
- Ignore the promotional detection warnings

## Understanding the 5 Pro Templates

### 1. Discount Template
**Best For**: General purpose, works for all stores
**Copy Formula**:
- Headline: "Wait! Don't Leave Empty Handed"
- Body: "Get [X]% off your order"
- CTA: "Claim My Discount"

**When to Use**: Default template, proven to work

### 2. Free Shipping Template
**Best For**: Stores with high shipping costs or average order value above $50
**Copy Formula**:
- Headline: "Free Shipping on Your Order!"
- Body: "We'll cover shipping if you order today"
- CTA: "Get Free Shipping"

**When to Use**: When shipping cost is a friction point

### 3. Urgency Template
**Best For**: Creating FOMO (fear of missing out)
**Copy Formula**:
- Headline: "Limited Time Offer"
- Body: "This deal expires in 24 hours"
- CTA: "Don't Miss Out"

**When to Use**: Seasonal sales, product launches, inventory clearance

### 4. Welcome Template
**Best For**: First-time visitors
**Copy Formula**:
- Headline: "Welcome to [Store Name]!"
- Body: "Enjoy [X]% off your first order"
- CTA: "Get My Welcome Offer"

**When to Use**: New customer acquisition campaigns

### 5. Reminder Template
**Best For**: Returning visitors with items in cart
**Copy Formula**:
- Headline: "You Left Something Behind"
- Body: "Complete your order and save [X]%"
- CTA: "Finish My Order"

**When to Use**: Retargeting campaigns, cart abandonment

### Template Testing Strategy

**Week 1-2**: Test Discount template only (establish baseline)
**Week 3-4**: Test Free Shipping template (compare to discount)
**Week 5+**: Rotate Urgency and Welcome based on campaigns

**AI Tip**: When AI mode is active, it will automatically test variations of whichever template you've selected.

## Budget Cap Strategy Guide

Setting the right budget cap is crucial for profitability.

### Calculating Your Budget Cap

**Step 1: Calculate Your Margin**
- Average Order Value: $100
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $40
- Gross Margin: $60 (60%)

**Step 2: Determine Acceptable Discount**
- If you're willing to sacrifice 25% of margin to acquire a customer:
- $60 × 0.25 = $15 acceptable discount per order

**Step 3: Set Your Weekly Cap**
- Expected orders per week: 50
- Budget Cap: 50 orders × $15 = $750/week

**Step 4: Monitor and Adjust**
- If conversion rate is 5%: 50 orders ÷ 0.05 = 1,000 impressions needed
- Your 10,000 monthly impressions = ~2,500/week
- You have plenty of headroom

### Budget Cap Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Set cap at 20% of gross margin initially
2. **Track ROI**: Calculate (Revenue - Discount Spend) to ensure profitability
3. **Adjust Monthly**: Increase cap if ROI is positive, decrease if negative
4. **Seasonal Variance**: Increase cap during peak seasons (Black Friday, holidays)
5. **Emergency Stop**: If something goes wrong, AI will stop at your cap

## Advanced Cart Value Targeting

Pro tier gives you precise control over who sees offers.

### Targeting Strategy Examples

#### Strategy 1: Protect High-Value Carts
- **Goal**: Don't discount large orders (they're likely to convert anyway)
- **Settings**:
  - Minimum: $25 (filter out tiny carts)
  - Maximum: $200 (don't show to large carts)
- **Result**: Focus discounts on mid-range abandoners

#### Strategy 2: Rescue Low-Intent Browsers
- **Goal**: Convert window shoppers with small carts
- **Settings**:
  - Minimum: $15
  - Maximum: $75
  - Aggression: 7/10 (more generous offer)
- **Result**: Turn browsers into buyers

#### Strategy 3: Premium Strategy
- **Goal**: Only show to qualified leads
- **Settings**:
  - Minimum: $100
  - Maximum: $500
  - Aggression: 3/10 (conservative offer)
- **Result**: Nudge high-intent shoppers without eroding margin

### Combining with Time Delays

**Low-Value Carts** ($0-50): Show after 30 seconds (quick decision)
**Mid-Value Carts** ($50-150): Show after 45 seconds (more consideration)
**High-Value Carts** ($150+): Show after 60 seconds (careful decision)

## Promotional Detection: What to Do

Pro tier warns you about site-wide promotions but doesn't auto-optimize (that's Enterprise). Here's what to do:

### When You See a Promotion Warning

**Scenario 1: Your site-wide sale is BIGGER than your exit-intent offer**
- Example: Site-wide 25% off, exit-intent offers 15%
- **Action**: Disable exit-intent or increase offer to 30%

**Scenario 2: Your exit-intent offer is BIGGER than site-wide sale**
- Example: Site-wide 10% off, exit-intent offers 20%
- **Action**: Reduce exit-intent to 15% to avoid confusion

**Scenario 3: Offers are SAME**
- Example: Both are 20% off
- **Action**: Disable exit-intent (redundant) or change messaging to "Stack Your Savings"

**Upgrade to Enterprise**: Auto-optimization handles this for you automatically.

## Common Questions (Pro Tier)

### How does AI mode decide which variant wins?
AI uses statistical significance testing. It needs at least 100 impressions per variant before declaring a winner. The variant with the higher conversion rate (or revenue, depending on your goal) becomes the champion.

### Can I manually create my own variants?
On Pro, no. AI creates variants automatically based on your baseline. Manual variant control is an Enterprise feature.

### What if I want to test more than 2 variants?
Upgrade to Enterprise for up to 10 simultaneous variants.

### How do unique discount codes work?
When enabled, Resparq automatically generates unique codes via Shopify API. Each code is valid for 24 hours and can only be used once. Cleanup happens automatically.

### Can I see which specific modal led to each conversion?
Yes, in the Conversions table under Analytics. However, full modal preview snapshots (showing exact copy and design) are Enterprise-only.

### What happens when I hit my budget cap?
Depending on your settings, modals either:
1. Switch to announcement mode (no discount offered), or
2. Stop showing entirely until next period

You'll receive an email notification.

### How do I export my conversion data?
Excel export is an Enterprise feature. On Pro, you can manually copy data from the Conversions table.
