#### Key Metrics (Last 30 Days)
Your dashboard displays four critical metrics from the last 30 days:

   - The total revenue generated from orders created through your exit-intent offers
   - This is the money you would have lost without Resparq

2. **Orders Created**
   - The number of customers who completed a purchase after seeing your offer
   - Each order represents a recovered abandoned cart

3. **Times Shown (Impressions)**
   - How many times your modal was displayed to visitors
   - Tracks against your 1,000/month limit

4. **Success Rate (Conversion Rate)**
   - Percentage of people who saw your offer and completed a purchase
   - Industry benchmark: 3-5% is good, 5-8% is excellent, 8%+ is outstanding

#### Usage Statistics
Your dashboard also shows:
- **Impression Usage Bar**: Visual indicator of how many impressions you've used this month
- **Percentage Used**: Exact percentage of your 1,000 monthly impressions consumed
- **Reset Date**: When your impression counter resets for the new month

## Configuring Your Settings

Navigate to the **Settings** page from your app menu to customize your exit-intent modal.

### Quick Setup Tab

This is where you'll configure the core elements of your offer:

#### Modal Content
- **Modal Headline**: The main attention-grabbing text (e.g., "Wait! Don't Leave Empty Handed")
- **Modal Body Text**: Supporting copy that explains your offer (e.g., "Get 15% off your first order")
- **CTA Button Text**: The call-to-action text on your button (e.g., "Claim My Discount")

#### Trigger Configuration

**Exit Intent Trigger**
- Toggle on/off
- When enabled, modal appears when visitor's mouse moves toward closing the browser
- Best for desktop users

**Time Delay Trigger**
- Set how many seconds after page load to show the modal
- Default: 30 seconds
- Recommended range: 15-60 seconds depending on your average time on site

**Cart Value Targeting**
- **Minimum Cart Value**: Only show offer if cart total is above this amount
- **Maximum Cart Value**: Only show offer if cart total is below this amount
- Leave blank for no restrictions
- Example: Min $50, Max $500 to target mid-range carts

#### Discount Settings

**Discount Type**
- **Percentage Discount**: e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%
- **Fixed Amount Discount**: e.g., $5, $10, $25

**How Discount Codes Work**
- Resparq **automatically creates the discount code in Shopify** when you save your settings
- You don't need to manually create anything in Shopify
- The code format is automatic:
  - Percentage: `15OFF`, `20OFF`, etc.
  - Fixed amount: `10DOLLARSOFF`, `25DOLLARSOFF`, etc.
- If the code already exists, Resparq will use it
- The discount is automatically applied at checkout for your customers

**Redirect Destination**
- Choose where customers go after clicking your CTA button
- Options:
  - **Checkout**: Send directly to checkout (recommended for higher conversion)
  - **Cart**: Send to cart page (gives customers a chance to review)

### Branding Tab (Locked - Enterprise Only)

The Branding tab is visible in your settings, but it's locked on the Starter plan. When you click on it, you'll see an upgrade screen.

**What's Available on Enterprise:**
- Custom colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- Custom fonts
- Logo upload
- Custom CSS for complete design control

To access branding customization, you'll need to upgrade to the Enterprise plan ($299/month).

## Understanding Your Analytics

Your Starter plan includes basic analytics to help you track performance.

### Accessing Analytics

While advanced analytics are reserved for Pro and Enterprise tiers, you can still see:

- **Dashboard Metrics**: The four key metrics on your main dashboard (revenue, orders, impressions, conversion rate)
- **Real-Time Status**: Whether your modal is currently enabled
- **Usage Tracking**: Your impression count against your 1,000/month limit

### What the Metrics Mean

**Revenue Saved**
- Direct revenue attributed to your exit-intent offers
- Calculated by summing all order values from customers who clicked your offer

**Orders Created**
- Count of completed purchases
- Only counts orders where the customer interacted with your modal

**Times Shown**
- Total impressions in the current billing period
- Resets monthly on your billing anniversary date

**Success Rate**
- Formula: (Orders Created ÷ Times Shown) × 100
- Example: 50 orders from 1,000 impressions = 5% conversion rate

### Upgrade for Advanced Analytics

Want more detailed insights? Upgrade to Pro or Enterprise to unlock:
- **Per-Modal Performance Tracking**: See how individual modals perform
- **Conversion Tracking**: Detailed table with timestamps, order numbers, customer emails
- **Date Range Filtering**: Analyze performance over custom time periods
- **AI Variant Testing**: Automatically test different offers (Pro: 2 variants, Enterprise: 10 variants)
- **Export to Excel**: Download all conversion data (Enterprise only)

## Best Practices for Starter Plan Success

### 1. Craft a Compelling Offer
- **Be Clear**: Make sure your discount is easy to understand
- **Create Urgency**: Use language like "Limited Time" or "Don't Miss Out"
- **Test Different Amounts**: Try 10%, 15%, or 20% to find your sweet spot

### 2. Optimize Your Timing
- **Exit Intent**: Great for desktop users browsing your site
- **Time Delay**: 30-45 seconds works well for most stores
- **Don't Show Too Soon**: Let customers browse first before interrupting

### 3. Target the Right Customers
- **Cart Value Minimums**: Don't give discounts on very small orders (consider $25-50 minimum)
- **Cart Value Maximums**: Save your margin on very large orders (consider $200-500 maximum)
- **Test and Adjust**: Monitor your metrics and adjust thresholds based on performance

### 4. Monitor Your Impression Limit
- You have 1,000 impressions per month
- Track your usage in the dashboard
- If you're hitting your limit early in the month, consider:
  - Tightening your cart value thresholds
  - Increasing your time delay
  - Upgrading to Pro for 10,000 impressions/month

### 5. Make Your Copy Count
Great modal copy follows this formula:
- **Headline**: Grab attention ("Wait! Before You Go...")
- **Body**: State the offer clearly ("Save 15% on Your First Order")
- **CTA**: Make it actionable ("Get My Discount Now")

## Common Questions

### How do discount codes work?
You don't need to manually create discount codes! Resparq automatically creates them in your Shopify admin when you save your modal settings. Just set your discount percentage or fixed amount in Resparq, click Save, and the code is created automatically. You can view it in Shopify Admin → Discounts if you want to verify.

### What happens when I reach 1,000 impressions?
- Your modal will stop showing to new visitors
- Your counter resets on your monthly billing anniversary
- You can upgrade to Pro (10,000/month) or Enterprise (unlimited) anytime

### Can I use multiple discount codes?
On the Starter plan, you can only use one discount code at a time. To test multiple offers or templates, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

### How do I know if it's working?
- Check your dashboard for "Orders Created" - if this number is increasing, it's working!
- Look at your "Success Rate" - aim for 3% or higher
- Monitor "Revenue Saved" - this is money you wouldn't have made without Resparq

### What if my conversion rate is low?
Try these fixes:
- Increase your discount amount
- Improve your copy (clearer headline, stronger CTA)
- Adjust your timing (try 45 seconds instead of 30)
- Narrow your targeting (only show to carts above a certain value)
