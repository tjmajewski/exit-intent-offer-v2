## UPDATED POSITIONING

### **New Tagline**
"Exit intent powered by evolution"

### **New Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds)
Repsarq uses evolutionary AI to recover abandoning shoppers with personalized offers that convert instantly. Our system creates hundreds of modal variants, tests them automatically using Bayesian statistics, and evolves the best performers—like natural selection for your checkout. Add dynamic social proof ("Join 5k+ customers"), automatic discount codes, and margin protection. Result? AI that gets smarter every day while you focus on growth.

### **Key Differentiators (UPDATED)**
1. **Evolutionary AI** - Creates & evolves variants automatically (not manual A/B testing)
2. **Thompson Sampling** - Optimal traffic allocation using Bayesian statistics
3. **Dynamic Social Proof** - "Join 5k+ customers" updates from your real metrics
4. **Auto-Applied Discounts** - Zero friction checkout
5. **Margin Protection** - Budget caps + promotional intelligence

## THE PROBLEM (Updated)
```
Headline: Traditional Exit Popups Are Stuck in 2015

Three Problems:

1. 📧 Force Email Capture
   Delays conversion by hours or days
   Most emails never get opened
   
2. 🔧 Manual A/B Testing
   Takes weeks to see results
   Only tests 2-3 variants max
   You have to do all the work
   
3. 💸 Dumb Discounts
   Everyone gets the same offer
   High-intent buyers get unnecessary discounts
   Low-intent browsers don't get enough

## THE SOLUTION (New Section)
```
Headline: Evolution Finds What Converts

Repsarq doesn't just test variants—it breeds them.

How Evolutionary AI Works:

1. 🌱 Generation 0: Creates 10 Random Variants
   Different headlines, CTAs, offers, urgency
   Pure exploration to find what works
   
2. 🧬 Natural Selection: Best Performers Survive
   Poor performers die after 100 impressions
   Top performers breed to create offspring
   Genes mix and mutate for new combinations
   
3. 👑 Champion Emerges: Winner Takes 70% Traffic
   After 500+ impressions and 7+ days
   95% statistical confidence it's the best
   Continues evolving to find even better variants
   
4. 📈 Continuous Improvement: Never Stops Learning
   Creates Generation 2, 3, 4... automatically
   Each generation performs 5-10% better
   You do nothing—AI handles everything

## PRO VS ENTERPRISE (New Comparison)
```
Headline: When to Upgrade to Enterprise

You Need Enterprise If:

✅ You run frequent promotions
   → Promotional intelligence auto-adjusts strategy
   
✅ You're brand-conscious  
   → Brand safety validates all AI-generated copy
   
✅ You want manual control
   → Kill/Protect/Champion specific variants
   
✅ You're high-traffic (100k+ visitors/mo)
   → Device-specific evolution (mobile vs desktop)
   
✅ You're analytical
   → Tune mutation rates, crossover, selection pressure

Stay on Pro If:

✅ You prefer "set it and forget it"
   → AI runs completely autonomously
   
✅ You trust the AI
   → Default settings work great for most stores
   
✅ You're focused on growth
   → Spend time on marketing, not tweaking modals

## SOCIAL PROOF FEATURE (New Section)
```
Headline: Trust Signals That Actually Work

"Join 5,000+ Happy Customers"

Dynamic Social Proof:
- Fetches your real Shopify metrics daily
- Shows order counts: "5k+ orders shipped"
- Displays ratings: "Rated 4.8★ by verified buyers"
- Only shows if impressive (100+ orders minimum)

How It Works:
1. Collects Data: Order count, customer count, ratings
2. Formats Nicely: 5,247 → "5k+" (more credible)
3. Updates Daily: Always fresh and accurate
4. Smart Display: Hides if numbers are too small

Merchant Controls:
- Enable/disable social proof
- Choose metric (orders vs customers)
- Set minimum threshold
- Manual refresh button

Example Headlines:
- "{{social_proof_count}} customers trust us"
- "Rated {{rating}} stars by verified buyers"
- "Join {{social_proof_count}} satisfied shoppers"

Visual: Before/After showing regular vs social proof modal
CTA: See Social Proof in Action

## TECHNICAL CREDIBILITY (New Section for Investors)
```
Headline: Built on Proven Science

Repsarq uses established algorithms from academia and industry:

Thompson Sampling (1933)
- Bayesian bandit algorithm
- Provably optimal exploration/exploitation
- Used by Google, Microsoft, Netflix

Genetic Algorithms (1960s)
- Crossover and mutation operators
- Selection pressure for convergence
- Applied to everything from NASA to finance

Bayesian Statistics (1700s)
- Beta distributions for conversion modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation for confidence
- 95% certainty before killing variants

Why This Matters:
- Not "black box" AI—explainable decisions
- Proven in production at scale
- Conservative with your budget
- Results backed by mathematics

## UPDATED FAQ

Add These Questions:

Q: How is evolutionary AI different from regular A/B testing?
A: Traditional A/B testing:
   • Tests 2-3 variants manually
   • Takes weeks to reach significance
   • Requires you to create variants
   • Stops when test completes
   
   Evolutionary AI:
   • Tests 100s of variants automatically
   • Reaches significance in days
   • Creates variants for you
   • Never stops improving

Q: What is Thompson Sampling?
A: It's a Bayesian algorithm that automatically gives more traffic to winning variants while still exploring alternatives. Much smarter than random 50/50 splits.

Q: Will AI-generated copy be off-brand?
A: Pro tier: AI picks from your chosen gene pools (you control the options)
   Enterprise tier: Brand safety validation rejects off-brand variants automatically

Q: How does social proof work?
A: We fetch your order counts and ratings from Shopify daily. If you have 5,000 orders, modals show "Join 5k+ customers." If you only have 50 orders, we don't show it (never displays small/unimpressive numbers).

Q: What if I want to manually control variants?
A: Upgrade to Enterprise for:
   • Kill: Remove a variant immediately
   • Protect: Prevent variant from being killed
   • Champion: Force a specific variant to win

Q: How long until I see a Champion?
A: Typically 2-4 weeks. Requirements:
   • 500+ impressions
   • 7+ days alive
   • Beats all others with 95% confidence

Q: Can I tune the evolution settings?
A: Enterprise only. Adjust:
   • Mutation rate (0-100%)
   • Crossover rate (0-100%)
   • Selection pressure (1-10)
   • Population size (5-20 variants)
