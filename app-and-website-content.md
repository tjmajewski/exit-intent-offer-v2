## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

### **Official Tagline**
"Exit intent that drives sales, not signups"

### **Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds)
ResparQ uses AI to recover abandoning shoppers with intelligent discounts - converting in seconds, not days later via email. Unlike traditional exit popups, we don't force email capture. We show personalized offers, auto-apply discounts, and send customers directly to checkout. Result? 6x higher recovery rates than email-based solutions.

### **Core Differentiators**
1. No email required (converts immediately)
2. Auto-applied discounts (zero friction)
3. AI with 13 customer signals (smarter decisions)
4. Margin protection (never discount too much)
5. Promotional intelligence (detects your sales)

Stop Losing Sales at Checkout

70% of shoppers abandon their carts. ResparQ recovers them with AI-powered exit intent modals that convert in seconds - not days later via email.

Unlike traditional exit popups, ResparQ:
• No email required - converts immediately
• Auto-applies discounts - zero friction

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PERFORMANCE-FIRST APPROACH

The result? 6x higher recovery rates than email-based solutions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INTELLIGENT AI DECISION ENGINE

ResparQ analyzes 13 customer signals to make smart decisions:
✓ Cart value
✓ Visit history
✓ Device type
✓ Time on site
✓ Scroll depth
✓ Traffic source
✓ Abandonment history
✓ Cart hesitation
✓ Product dwell time
✓ And more...

Then automatically decides:
• Should we show a modal?
• What discount amount?
• Which message?
• When to show it?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NO A/B TESTING REQUIRED

While competitors make you manually test variants, ResparQ's AI:
• Generates 100s of message combinations

## 💬 KEY TALKING POINTS

### **Overcoming Objections**

**"We already have exit popups"**
→ "Great! Are they converting abandoners immediately or just collecting emails? ResparQ focuses on instant conversion with auto-applied discounts, not delayed email recovery."

**"Won't discounts hurt our margins?"**
→ "ResparQ includes margin protection - you set your minimum threshold and AI never discounts below it. Plus, our promotional intelligence detects your sales and adjusts automatically."

**"How is this different from [competitor]?"**
→ "Three key differences: 1) We don't require email capture, 2) Our AI tests 100s of variants automatically, and 3) We focus on revenue recovery, not email list growth."

**"AI sounds complicated"**
→ "Actually, AI makes it simpler. Instead of manually A/B testing for weeks, you install once and let the AI optimize everything automatically. Most merchants never touch it again."

**"We're too small for this"**
→ "Our free Starter plan is perfect for smaller stores. You get professional templates and auto-applied discounts with zero monthly cost."

**"What if customers abuse discounts?"**
→ "Our AI learns quickly. If someone always waits for a discount, the AI adjusts their offer or shows a cart reminder instead. Plus, discounts expire in 24 hours."
