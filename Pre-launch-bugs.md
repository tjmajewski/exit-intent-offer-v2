1. Modal is not displaying
2. When I navigate between starter, pro, and enterprise it’s not always in line and it changes from time to time, I’d rather just keep the toggle of the different plan types on the left side bar and make that universal and make Sure the storefront knows that when I save a modal when I’m on that plan that is the plan type and modal I want to see. I also want to make sure it’s truly only seeable from dev. 
3. I know exit intent trigger works on manual mode, but I don’t think the timer trigger works
4. When I’m on a pro plan, the upsell message needs to change from A/B testing
5. Also on the pro plan, the number of impressions isn’t showing unless I switch away from pro and then back to it. Want to make sure it always shows for pro
6. I want to make sure the impression reset works correctly, for some reason it’s back at 0 and says it’ll restart in a month
7. When I’m on my dashboard, the preview modal that is live should not appear to be clickable when I hover on it
8. I need to update the copy on my upsell message from pro to enterprise 
9. When I’m in settings, the ‘advanced’ tab should have a pro label on it but I want customers to be able to click it and get a similar message to the other tabs they can click on for what they could get 
10. I want to give starter customers the ability to set the timer pop up so they can get a modal to show on mobile devices
11. When I open up manual settings, I want the first template pre selected, and that content to be filled in on ‘modal content’ right now that is blank and I have to click a template
12. I want the styling of all the upsell to match everywhere, right now it’s different on just about every upsell message
13. This isn’t a bug, but I need a document to explain all of my AI decisions and displaying between Pro and Enterprise
14. I need to double check the budget cap actually works in AI mode
15. I need to check that the cart value range works in manual mode
16. I need to cut emojis on the upsell message on the ‘promotions’ page
17. On the promotions page, I can’t tell a customer to test if there’s no promotions active: No active site-wide promotions detected. Create a discount code in Shopify to test! 
18. The recent activity seems like overkill, I don’t think it should show every time a modal is displayed, I need more of an impactful activity
19. Last thing I think, so right now I have a live modal, and sometimes one that’s in the works. Throughout settings I have a way to ‘Preview Modal’ and it’s broken. But I think design wise that ‘Preview modal’ makes more sense by the save button and should be across all settings tabs. So a customer can ‘Preview’ what changes they’ve made before saving the modal. If no changes to the modal are made, the ‘Preview modal’ button should always show them what the modal would be based on the settings selected. IF AI mode is selected then placeholder copy of what the modal would say should be in the ‘Preview’
