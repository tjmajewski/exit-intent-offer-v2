## Genetic Algorithm Evolution: How It Works

Enterprise AI uses a sophisticated genetic algorithm. Understanding it helps you optimize settings.

### The Evolution Cycle

**Step 1: Initial Population**
- AI creates 10 variants (if population size = 10)
- Each variant has different "genes":
  - Headline copy
  - Body copy
  - CTA text
  - Discount amount
  - Visual style (colors, layout)
  - Urgency level

**Step 2: Testing Phase**
- All 10 variants shown randomly to visitors
- Each gets equal exposure initially
- AI tracks impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue

**Step 3: Selection (Based on Quality Standards)**
- After enough impressions, AI evaluates performance
- Selection pressure determines how quickly to eliminate losers:
  - Pressure 1: Keep all 10 variants for 500+ impressions each
  - Pressure 5: Eliminate bottom 50% after 200 impressions
  - Pressure 10: Eliminate bottom 50% after 100 impressions

**Step 4: Crossover (Based on Learning Strategy)**
- Survivors are used to create next generation
- Crossover rate determines how:
  - 0%: Create completely new variants (ignore winners)
  - 50%: Combine elements from top 2 winners
  - 100%: Only create variants by combining winners
- Example: Winner A headline + Winner B discount amount = New variant

**Step 5: Mutation (Based on Innovation Speed)**
- New variants are slightly mutated
- Mutation rate determines how much:
  - 0%: No changes (exact combinations)
  - 50%: Moderate changes (tweak 50% of genes)
  - 100%: Major changes (randomize all genes)

**Step 6: Repeat**
- New generation of 10 variants is tested
- Cycle repeats indefinitely
- Each cycle is called a "generation"

### Visual Gene Evolution (ENTERPRISE EXCLUSIVE)

AI also evolves visual elements:

**Color Genes:**
- Primary color
- Secondary color
- Button color
- Background color

**Layout Genes:**
- Modal size
- Corner radius
- Padding
- Shadow depth

**Typography Genes:**
- Font family
- Font size
- Font weight
- Line height

**Animation Genes:**
- Entrance animation
- Hover effects
- Timing

**How Visual Evolution Works:**
- AI tests different color combinations
- Tracks which visual styles convert better
- Combines winning visual genes with winning copy genes
- Creates cohesive high-converting modals

**Example Evolution:**
- Gen 1: 10 random variants (all different colors, copy, layouts)
- Gen 2: Top 3 variants from Gen 1 are combined and mutated
- Gen 3: Best elements from Gen 2 are refined
- Gen 4: Near-optimal variants with small tweaks
- Gen 5+: Continuous optimization of winning formula

## Social Proof: Implementation Guide

Social proof increases conversion by building trust and FOMO.

### Setting Up Social Proof

**Step 1: Choose Your Metric**

**Orders** (Recommended for most stores)
- "Join 1,234 customers who ordered this month"
- Shows recent purchase activity
- Creates urgency and trust

**Customers** (For established stores)
- "5,678 happy customers and counting"
- Shows overall customer base
- Builds credibility

**Reviews** (For stores with strong reviews)
- "Rated 4.9 stars by 890 customers"
- Shows quality/satisfaction
- Builds trust through social validation

**Step 2: Set Minimum Threshold**

Don't show social proof until you reach credibility:
- **Orders**: Minimum 25 (shows you're active)
- **Customers**: Minimum 100 (shows you're established)
- **Reviews**: Minimum 25 (shows consistent feedback)

**Why?**: Showing "Join 5 customers" hurts more than it helps.

**Step 3: Configure Auto-Fetch**

- Enable automatic data fetch from Shopify
- AI pulls real numbers every 4 hours
- Manual refresh button for immediate update

**Step 4: Choose Placement**

**Above Headline** (Recommended):
```
Join 847 customers who ordered today
---
Wait! Don't Leave Empty Handed
Save 15% on Your Order
[Claim My Discount]
```

**Below Body**:
```
Wait! Don't Leave Empty Handed
Save 15% on Your Order
---
Join 847 customers who ordered today
[Claim My Discount]
```

**In Footer** (Subtle):
```
Wait! Don't Leave Empty Handed
Save 15% on Your Order
[Claim My Discount]
---
Join 847 customers who ordered today
```

**Best Practice**: Above headline for maximum impact.

### Social Proof Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use real numbers (auto-fetch from Shopify)
- Update frequently (every 4 hours minimum)
- Set realistic minimum thresholds
- Match metric to your brand (luxury = customers, fast-moving = orders)
- A/B test placement

**Don't:**
- Inflate numbers (customers will notice)
- Show low numbers (under 25)
- Use static numbers (update regularly)
- Overcomplicate messaging (keep it simple)

### Social Proof + AI Testing

AI will automatically test social proof variations:
- With vs. without social proof
- Different metrics (orders vs. customers)
- Different placements
- Different messaging ("Join X customers" vs. "X happy customers")

Let AI determine what works best for your audience.

## Promotional Intelligence: Advanced Strategy

Promotional intelligence is one of Enterprise's most powerful features.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Automatic Detection**

Resparq scans your store every hour for:
- Active Shopify discount codes
- Site-wide promotions
- Free shipping offers
- BFCM/seasonal sales
- Percentage and fixed amount discounts

**Step 2: Conflict Analysis**

When a promotion is detected, AI analyzes:
- **Promotion Amount**: 20% off site-wide
- **Exit-Intent Offer**: 15% off for abandoners
- **Conflict**: Exit-intent is worse deal → confusion

**Step 3: Automatic Strategy Selection**

AI chooses best strategy:

**Pause** (Exit-intent offer is worse):
- Site-wide: 25% off
- Exit-intent: 15% off
- Action: Pause exit-intent (would confuse customers)

**Increase** (Beat the site-wide offer):
- Site-wide: 15% off
- Exit-intent: Normally 15% off
- Action: Increase exit-intent to 20% (better for abandoners)

**Continue** (Offers are complementary):
- Site-wide: Free shipping
- Exit-intent: 15% off
- Action: Continue (stack savings)

**Ignore** (Merchant override):
- You manually set strategy
- AI respects your decision

**Step 4: Execution**

AI implements strategy automatically:
- No manual intervention required
- Adjusts in real-time
- Reverts when promotion ends

**Step 5: Performance Tracking**

Dashboard shows impact:
- Revenue during promotion
- Conversion rate during promotion
- Strategy effectiveness

### Managing Promotions

Navigate to **Promotions** page (linked from dashboard widget):

**For Each Detected Promotion:**
- **Promo Code**: SUMMER25
- **Amount**: 25% off
- **Status**: Active
- **AI Strategy**: Pause
- **Start Date**: June 1, 2026
- **End Date**: June 30, 2026
- **Manual Override**: Available

**Manual Override Options:**

**Force Zero Percent**
- Switch exit-intent to announcement mode
- No discount offered (just messaging)
- Use when: You don't want to give additional discounts during promo

**Force Specific Aggression (1-10)**
- Override AI with custom level
- Example: Force level 8 to beat site-wide 25% with 30%
- Use when: You want specific discount amount

**Force Pause**
- Stop showing exit-intent entirely
- Use when: Site-wide promo is so good, exit-intent is redundant

**Force Continue**
- Ignore conflict, show normal exit-intent
- Use when: You want to stack offers

**Merchant Note Field**
- Add notes for team
- Explain override rationale
- Track learnings for future promos

### Promotional Intelligence Best Practices

**For Black Friday/Cyber Monday:**
- Let AI detect and auto-pause exit-intent
- Site-wide discounts are usually better than targeted offers
- Resume exit-intent after BFCM ends

**For Seasonal Sales (20-30% off):**
- Use "increase" strategy to beat sale by 5%
- Example: 25% sale → 30% exit-intent
- Rewards abandoners with best deal

**For Free Shipping Promotions:**
- Use "continue" strategy
- Stack free shipping + percentage discount
- Messaging: "Get Free Shipping + 15% Off"

**For Product-Specific Promotions:**
- Use "ignore" or "continue"
- Exit-intent can target different products
- Segment by cart contents

**For End-of-Season Clearance:**
- Use "pause" if clearance is deeper than exit-intent
- Or use "increase" to beat clearance by 5%

### Custom Promotional Strategies

**Strategy 1: Tiered Offers**
- Site-wide: 15% off
- Exit-intent: 20% off (for abandoners only)
- Rewards people who were leaving with better deal

**Strategy 2: Exclusive Access**
- Site-wide: General 20% off
- Exit-intent: "VIP access to 25% off"
- Creates exclusivity feeling

**Strategy 3: Stack & Save**
- Site-wide: Free shipping
- Exit-intent: "Free shipping + save 15%"
- Explicitly call out stacking

**Strategy 4: Different Value Props**
- Site-wide: 20% off
- Exit-intent: Free gift with purchase (no discount)
- Non-conflicting offers

## Meta-Learning: Contributing to the Platform

Enterprise customers can opt-in to meta-learning, which helps improve the platform for everyone.

### What is Meta-Learning?

Resparq aggregates anonymized performance data across all participating stores to identify universal best practices.

**What's Shared (Anonymized Only):**
- Aggregate conversion rates by segment
- Which copy patterns perform best
- Optimal discount amounts by industry
- Seasonal performance patterns

**What's NOT Shared:**
- Customer data (emails, names, addresses)
- Order details
- Store name or URL
- Specific offer amounts
- Any personally identifiable information

### How It Helps You

**1. Bootstrapping for New Variants**
- When AI creates new variants, it uses meta-learning insights
- Example: "Emoji in headlines increase CVR by 12% for fashion stores"
- AI incorporates emoji more often for fashion stores

**2. Industry Benchmarks**
- Compare your performance to similar stores
- Dashboard shows "You're in top 25% of fashion stores"

**3. Seasonal Optimization**
- Meta-learning identifies seasonal patterns
- Example: "Urgency messaging performs 34% better during Black Friday"
- AI automatically adjusts for seasonality

**4. Segment-Specific Insights**
- Mobile vs. desktop
- Paid vs. organic traffic
- New vs. returning visitors
- Cart value segments

### Opting In/Out

**To Opt In (Default):**
- Settings → Advanced → Meta-Learning Contribution: ON
- Your anonymized data helps improve the platform
- You benefit from insights from thousands of other stores

**To Opt Out:**
- Settings → Advanced → Meta-Learning Contribution: OFF
- You still benefit from meta-learning (receive insights)
- You just don't contribute your data

**Recommendation:** Opt in. It helps everyone and costs you nothing (data is fully anonymized).

## Common Enterprise Questions

### How long until AI finds optimal variants?
Typically 4-8 weeks with consistent traffic. High-traffic stores (50,000+ monthly impressions) may see results in 2-3 weeks.

### Can I manually create variants instead of relying on AI?
Yes. In Analytics → AI Variants, you can promote any variant to Champion and protect it from elimination. You can also kill all AI variants and create your own in Settings.

### How does AI handle multiple templates simultaneously?
AI evolves variants within each template separately. If you enable both Discount and Free Shipping templates, AI will optimize each independently, then determine which template performs better overall.

### What if I want to completely override AI?
Go to Settings → AI Settings and disable AI mode. Then manually configure your modal. You maintain full control at all times.

### How accurate is promotional intelligence detection?
Detection accuracy is >95% for Shopify-native discount codes. Third-party promotions may require manual input. You can always manually override AI strategy.

### Can I export raw impression/click data (not just conversions)?
Currently, Excel export includes conversions only. For raw impression/click data, contact enterprise support to request API access.

### Does social proof slow down my site?
No. Social proof data is cached and updated asynchronously every 4 hours. No impact on page load speed.

### Can I use Resparq on multiple stores?
Each Resparq subscription is per-store. Enterprise customers with multiple stores can contact support for multi-store discount pricing.

### How does meta-learning protect my competitive advantage?
All data is anonymized and aggregated across hundreds of stores. No store can identify another store's data. Insights are universal best practices (e.g., "urgency language increases CVR"), not specific to your offers or brand.

### What if I hit technical limits (API rate limits, data limits)?
Enterprise has no impression limits, variant limits, or data retention limits. If you're pushing 1M+ monthly impressions, contact support to ensure infrastructure can handle your scale.
